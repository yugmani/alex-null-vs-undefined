  <h1>null & undefined</h1>
  <h3>NULL</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Both, <code style="background-color: lightgray">undefined</code> and
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">null</code>, are primitive data
      types that exist in JavaScript.
    </li>
    <li>
      Another thing
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">undefined</code> and
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">null</code> have in common is
      that they are both <mark>falsy</mark> values.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you use undefined in a boolean context it will be considered
      <em>false</em>. <mark>Boolean context</mark> is a context which evaluates
      to boolean value, either <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>. One example of
      boolean context is condition in <code><em>if…else</em></code>
      statement. This is also why you should avoid testing for loose equality.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you test for loose equality there is <em>type coercion</em> on the
      background. Both,
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">undefined</code> and
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">null</code>, are
      <em>falsy</em> and this is what they will be considered. The result of
      test for <em>loose equality</em> will result in match. The result of this
      test will be <em>true</em>. However, this is not really correct.
    </li>
    <li>
      Instead of loose equality, test for <em>strict equality</em>. When you
      test for strict equality JavaScript doesn’t perform type coercion. Strict
      check will compare not only the value but also the data type.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">undefined</code> and
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">null</code> in JavaScript are
      different data types. Strict equality test will tell you, correctly, that
      <strong>these two are not the same</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unlike <em>undefined</em>,
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">null</code> is not assigned
      automatically when some conditions happen. Due to this, it has to be
      assigned by someone.
    </li>
    <li>
      Many JavaScript developers like to use
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">null</code> as a temporary
      value. It signals empty or non-existent value.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is one interesting thing on 'null' in JavaScript. It is actually an
      object. This object has a valid value, but no properties and it is
      non-mutable.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">typeof operator</code> with
      'null' will give 'object'. It is regarded as a mistake in the original
      implementation of JavaScript.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>null and garbage collection</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <mark>Garbage collection</mark> is a process for freeing up memory
          allocated for your code, your objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          It looks for unused existing objects in memory and removes them.
          JavaScript determines if an object is in use or not if it is
          referenced.
        </li>
        <li>
          When some object is no longer referenced, JavaScript will assume it is
          no longer needed and will remove it. This will free the memory
          allocated for that object. This process happens automatically and
          periodically on the background. This is one advantage of high-level
          languages such as JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          You don’t have to allocate memory every time you create an object.
          Just as well you don’t have to free that memory when you no longer
          need some object. JavaScript does this memory management for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          While JavaScript manages memory automatically you can tell JavaScript
          that some object can be garbage collected. One way to do this is by
          assigning a variable, that stores the object, null.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there are no other references to that object JavaScript will remove
          it. This will not happen immediately. It will happen during the next
          cycle of garbage collection.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>UNDEFINED</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When you declare a variable, but don’t assign it a value, it will become
      <mark>undefined</mark>.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can also assign variable undefined by yourself if you want. Although,
      this is not a common practice among JavaScript developers.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are other scenarios when you will get undefined.
      <ol>
        <li>
          When you try to access non-existing array element, it will return
          undefined
        </li>
        <li>
          When you try to access non-existing object properties, it will return
          undefined
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have a function that doesn’t explicitly return anything, then,
          it will implicitly return undefined.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a function has a return statement, but without anything that
          follows it, it will also implicitly return undefined.
        </li>
        <li>
          One interesting thing is that undefined is not valid in JSON, null is.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you try to get the type of a variable that is undefined JavaScript
          will return “undefined”.In JavaScript, the data type of undefined is a
          special value with its own type “Undefined”.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>undefined and default parameters values</strong></li>
    <li>
      <h4>undefined and destructuring assignment</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Destructuring assignment feature in ES6 allows us to extract values
          from arrays, and properties from objects, and assign them to
          variables.
        </li>
        <li>This feature supports default values also.</li>

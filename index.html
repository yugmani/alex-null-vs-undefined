<div id="app">
  <h1>null & undefined</h1>
  <h3>NULL</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Both, <code style="background-color: lightgray">undefined</code> and
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">null</code>, are primitive data
      types that exist in JavaScript.
    </li>
    <li>
      Another thing
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">undefined</code> and
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">null</code> have in common is
      that they are both <mark>falsy</mark> values.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you use undefined in a boolean context it will be considered
      <em>false</em>. <mark>Boolean context</mark> is a context which evaluates
      to boolean value, either <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>. One example of
      boolean context is condition in <code><em>if…else</em></code>
      statement. This is also why you should avoid testing for loose equality.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you test for loose equality there is <em>type coercion</em> on the
      background. Both,
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">undefined</code> and
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">null</code>, are
      <em>falsy</em> and this is what they will be considered. The result of
      test for <em>loose equality</em> will result in match. The result of this
      test will be <em>true</em>. However, this is not really correct.
    </li>
    <li>
      Instead of loose equality, test for <em>strict equality</em>. When you
      test for strict equality JavaScript doesn’t perform type coercion. Strict
      check will compare not only the value but also the data type.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">undefined</code> and
      <code style="background-color: lightgray">null</code> in JavaScript are
      different data types. Strict equality test will tell you, correctly, that
      <strong>these two are not the same</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>UNDEFINED</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When you declare a variable, but don’t assign it a value, it will become
      <mark>undefined</mark>.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can also assign variable undefined by yourself if you want. Although,
      this is not a common practice among JavaScript developers.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are other scenarios when you will get undefined.
      <ol>
        <li>
          When you try to access non-existing array element, it will return
          undefined
        </li>
        <li>
          When you try to access non-existing object properties, it will return
          undefined
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have a function that doesn’t explicitly return anything, then,
          it will implicitly return undefined.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a function has a return statement, but without anything that
          follows it, it will also implicitly return undefined.
        </li>
        <li>
          One interesting thing is that undefined is not valid in JSON, null is.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you try to get the type of a variable that is undefined JavaScript
          will return “undefined”.In JavaScript, the data type of undefined is a
          special value with its own type “Undefined”.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>undefined and default parameters values</strong></li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
</div>
